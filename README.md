# MediaPipe-OSC-IEM-StereoEncoder
This repository provides code for real-time hand tracking and spatial audio control. Using a camera feed, it tracks a userâ€™s hands, normalizes their position data, and sends the values via OSC. These OSC messages are designed for integration with the IEM VST3 plugin suite, which enables intuitive spatialization of audio in 3D environments.
